# Pacman
The Pacman game with multiple levels, smart ghosts, steps recording and replay feature and an option to build the board by the user, with high emphasize on OOP design and principles. Written in C++.

To play my Pacman game please enter one of the following inputs in the command line:
1. "-load" - re-play and see the game you did.
2. "-save" - the program will save your game moves so you can re-play your game when finished.
3. "-load-silent" - will make tests to see if the game you played is synced with the saved game. The user will see only the test's results.
4. no cmd input - play regular.
